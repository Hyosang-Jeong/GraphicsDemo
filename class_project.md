# CS250 Class Project

For the class project you with a team of up to three people will make a graphics demo program that showcases all the topics discussed in the course.

The demo will showcase all the topics and should have an intuitive way to pick which topic to view.

Each topic should have applicable sliders and/or modifiers to play around with the parameters which affect the topic.

The topics will be presented with OpenGL for practical examples, but you may implement the topics using other hardware accelerated graphics APIs like DirectX.

## Requirements


### Create the Demo Project

Your demo must show off the following topics

1. Procedural Geometric Modeling
	- Plane, Cube, Sphere, Torus, Cylinder, and Cone
2. Toon / Cell Shading
3. Fog
	- Linear and Exponential
4. Value noise
	- Implemented in C++ to generate a texture
5. Gradient noise / Perlin noise
	- Implented in C++ to generate a terrain mesh
6. Hermite Curves / Catmull-Rom Splines
7. Geometry and Tessellation Shaders
8. Shadow Mapping
	- From a Directional or Sun light

### Tech Requirements

You may use third party libraries to support your application(s). Things like glm, glfw, sdl2, Qt, stb, Dear ImGUI, etc... are all fine to use.

However all **CS250 topics must be implemented by the students**.

If you are unsure about whether or not you should use some third party library then ask the instructor.


## Submission

You will be submitting your work on GitHub with the provided class assignment repository. You will also create a copy of your project as a 7z file on the course site. 

The name of the 7z file must follow this naming convention: `[class_name]_[login]_project.7z`

For example, if a student had the login name fun.frank then the appropriate filename would be `cs250_fun.frank_project.7z`. Note: The .7z file names are case-sensitive and must be in all lowercase, exactly as described above.

In addition to the project development files, add pre-built binary files so that we can quickly and easily see your work running.

Note that we will be grading from the GitHub repo and we are using the 7z copy as a way to backup your work.

Scores for Assignments will be given as the following:

Score        | Assessment
------------ | ----------
F | Nothing turned in at all
D | Close to meeting core requirements
C | Meets all of the core requirements
B | Close to meeting all requirements
A | Clearly meets all requirements 
S | High quality, well beyond the requirements

### Suggestions to earn extra credit

#### Add a new topic

Study and create a Demo that wasn't discussed in class. **Computer Shaders** is highly recommended!

If you are aiming for extra credit then make sure to discuss the topic with the Instructor to make sure it is a good fit.


#### Create an Interactive Experience

To help show off your understanding of the topics, create another application that is an interactive experience utilizing all of the topics.

You can think of it like a game prototype where the prototype goal is to show off the graphics technology.

We suggest you create something like [The Aviator](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2016/04/26/the-aviator-animating-basic-3d-scene-threejs/). This has very minimal depth in terms of interactivity. All you do is move the mouse around to move the plane around a bit. That would be enough of an experience. Going all the way to making it a game where you earn points and avoid obstacles is not required. Even though you would just be moving the plane around, it has enough going on that you could easily use all the topics in the course to make it. 

You could use Toon Shading with Fog for the lighting. Geometry shaders to generate outlines. Procedural modeling to create all the geometry in the scene like clouds, the plane, the pilot, etc... You could use Value noise and Catmull-Rom Splines to drive animations. You could use Gradient noise to generate the ground terrain. You could use shadow mapping to cast shadows on the ground. You could add grass to the terrain with tessellation shaders.

Of course your group doesn't need to recreate The Aviator. You are welcome to create another kind of 3D experience, just so long as you keep the interactivity simple and utilize the graphics topics.
